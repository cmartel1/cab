    <h1>CAB Spring Concert Information</h1>

    <p>For the 2025 Spring Concert, we requested an equivalent budget for talent as this year's ($135,000), hoping to offer a similar experience, yet this was denied by Senate 21-3 last Wednesday. As this single event called for 18.5% of SGA’s operating budget in 2024, there are questions whether it is worth the investment moving forward.  We respect and understand their decision and concerns and are now seeking your feedback to best inform our appeal, eager to resubmit our request to align with the interests of our student body.
        <br><br>
        Hosting a private event with celebrity talent is very expensive. We provided some sample rate estimates below.
        
        Last year, we invested $95,000 into Ty Dolla $ign’s performance, and opened the show with two student DJs. The most common points of feedback included extending the duration of the show by investing in an opening artist and diversifying the genres of music offered.
        
        In response, we invested $100,000 into Swae Lee (Hip-Hop) to be the 2024 headliner and $35,000 for Trevor Daniel (Pop, Dance) to perform as the opening act. For 2024’s Spring Concert, 852 tickets were sold (up 43%) and the average rating of this event was 8.5/10 among attendees (up 39%). The average cost per person was $221 (down 9%), paid primarily by the student activities fee managed by SGA, to ensure tickets were offered for just $20 to make this event inclusive and accessibile to all.<br>
    <br>The total concert budget request for 2025 was $197,650, including talent, 10% agent fees, venue booking expense, and other costs like production, student transportation, and hospitality. The venue portion of this budget has been approved, while the rest was denied. </p>
